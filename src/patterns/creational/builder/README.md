Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same construction code.

### Solution:

- Director - The director class defines the order in which to execute the building steps, while the builder provides the implementation for those steps.
- Abstract builder - interfaces
- Concrete builder - implement the interfaces
- Product - object being built
