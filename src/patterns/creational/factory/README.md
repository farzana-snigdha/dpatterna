Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

## Problem:

- Uncertainties in types of objects
- Decisions to be made at runtime regarding what classes to use

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

## Problem:

- A family of related products, say: Chair + Sofa + CoffeeTable.

- Several variants of this family. For example, products Chair + Sofa + CoffeeTable are available in these variants: Modern, Victorian, ArtDeco.
